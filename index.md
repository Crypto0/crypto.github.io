Cybersecurity is one of the new trends in the computer world. Both governments and companies are struggling daily to protect their informations or even to be able to get rivals informations. We at pogTeam believe in a true hacker-style team for developing our cyber skills together by playing CTFs contests and discussing every security aspect of technology.


# CTF?

CTFs (Capture The Flag) are contests in the realm of computer security. It generally comes in two flavors, Jeopardy or Attack-Defense. The first one is the most common and consists of a few categories of challenges, from simple to highly complex ones. We at pogTeam focus at:

    * Web
    * Steganography
    * Reverse Engineering
    * Digital Forensics
